## CompareCCTV Assignment 📹

Excel sheet containing data on various CCTV cameras.📚

Define a clear and justifiable criteria for what constitutes a "top 10" CCTV camera. This is a critical step, as the term "top 10" is subjective and can be based on a variety of factors. Consider aspects such as price, features (e.g., night vision range, resolution), durability (e.g., waterproof rating), or a combination of these.

Using your defined criteria, identify the top 10 CCTV cameras from the provided dataset.

Justify your selection with a detailed explanation and a Python script. The script should demonstrate your data analysis process, including how you loaded the data, applied your criteria, and arrived at your final list. Please ensure your code is well-commented so we can easily understand your methodology.

## Idea of Techniques ✨

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, or converting data types.

Feature Engineering: Creating new metrics from existing data, such as an average price from Amazon and Flipkart.

Data Aggregation: Grouping data to find average values or counts.

Scoring Model: Developing a simple or complex scoring system to rank the products based on your chosen criteria.

### Environment 💡:
